# My Project

This application offers personalized movie recommendations based on user search, employing word embeddings to translate movie genres and summaries into dense numerical vectors. 
By calculating the shortest distances between these embeddings, the application intelligently matches user preferences with movie characteristics, delivering highly accurate and personalized recommendations.
The embeddings were generated using open Ai text model. The embeddings were then saved as a field in MongoDB database.
